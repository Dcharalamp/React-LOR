In this study the inactivation of viruses in the presence of quartz sand was examined. The bacteriophages\nMS2 and X174 were used as model viruses. Experiments were performed at 4 ◦C and 20 ◦C,\nunder constant controlled conditions, to investigate the effect of virus type, temperature, sand size, and\ninitial virus concentration on virus inactivation. The experimental virus inactivation data were satisfactorily\nrepresented by a pseudo-first order expression with time-dependent rate coefficients. Furthermore,\nthe results indicated that virus inactivation was substantially affected by the ambient temperature and\ninitial virus concentration. The inactivation rate of MS2 was shown to be greater than that of X174.\nHowever, the greatest inactivation was observed for MS2 without the presence of sand, at 20 ◦C. Sand\nsurfaces offered protection against inactivation especially under static conditions. However, no obvious\nrelationship between sand particle size and virus inactivation could be established from the experimental\ndata. Moreover, the inactivation rates were shown to increase with decreasing virus concentration",

Using a combination of portable whole genome sequencing, molecular clock and epidemiological analyses, we revealed the return of the CHIKV-ECSA genotype into Bahia. Our results show local persistence of lineages in some municipalities and the re-introduction of new epidemiological strains from different Brazilian regions, highlighting a complex dynamic of transmission between epidemic seasons and sampled locations. Estimated climate-driven transmission potential of CHIKV remained at similar levels throughout the years, such that large reductions in the total number of confirmed cases suggests a slow, but gradual accumulation of herd-immunity over the 4 years of the epidemic in Bahia after its introduction in 2014. Bahia remains a reservoir of the genetic diversity of CHIKV in the Americas, and genomic surveillance strategies are essential to assist in monitoring and understanding arboviral transmission and persistence both locally and over large distances.",

Here we discuss five cellular processes, namely \"autophagy\", \"programmed cell death\", \"immune response\", \"cell cycle alteration\", and \"lipid metabolic reprogramming\", that considerably guide viral replication after host infection in an orchestrated manner. On viral infection, \"autophagy\" and \"programmed cell death\" are two dynamically synchronized cell survival programs; \"immune response\" is a cell defense program typically suppressed by viruses; \"cell cycle alteration\" and \"lipid metabolic reprogramming\" are two altered cell housekeeping programs tunable in both directions. We emphasize on their functionalities in modulating viral replication, strategies viruses have evolved to tune these processes for their benefit, and how these processes orchestrate and govern cell fate upon viral infection. Understanding how viruses hijack host networks has both academic and industrial values in providing insights toward therapeutic strategy design for viral disease control, offering useful information in applications that aim to use viral vectors to improve human health such as gene therapy, and providing guidelines to maximize viral particle yield for improved vaccine production at a reduced cost.",

METHODS: Two hundred and thirty consecutive injecting drug users with chronic hepatitis C virus infection were evaluated for serological markers of hepatitis B virus infection. One hundred and three of them (44.8%) reported intravenous drug use beginning before 1992 (group A) and 127/230 (55.2%) after 1992 (group B). Statistical analysis of data was based on Student's t-test and chi analyses. RESULTS: Eighty-five of 103 patients from group A (82.5%) and 28/127 (22%) from group B had serological markers of previous hepatitis B virus infection (P&lt;0.001). Eleven patients from group A (10.6%) and 78 (61.4%) from group B were seronegative for all hepatitis B virus markers (P&lt;0.001). Only 3.8% (4/103) of group A patients and 16.5% (21/127) of group B had vaccination-induced protective antibody levels (anti-HBs) against hepatitis B (P=0.02). The majority of patients were infected with hepatitis C virus genotype-3 (64.7% from group A vs 56.7% from group B, P=0.42). The percentages of patients infected with genotype-1 were also comparable in both groups (15.5% from group A vs 30.8% from group B, P=0.09). A significantly higher percentage of group A patients were infected with genotype-4 (19.7%) than those in group B (4.9%, P=0.02). CONCLUSION: The serological profile of hepatitis B virus infection among Greek hepatitis C virus-infected injecting drug users is changing. The proportion of successfully vaccinated hepatitis B virus injecting drug users, although significantly higher than the previous decades, is still relatively low. Vaccination policy in this high-risk group for viral hepatitis is urgently needed.",

These elements can recombine with exogenous, infectious FeLVs of subgroup A (FeLV-A), giving rise to host range variants of FeLV-B. We found that a subset of defective enFeLV proviruses is highly expressed in lymphoma cell lines and in a variety of primary tissues, including lymphoid tissues from healthy specific-pathogen-free cats. At least two RNA species were detected, a 4.5-kb RNA containing gag, env, and long terminal repeat sequences and a 2-kb RNA containing env and long terminal repeat sequences. Cloning of enFeLV cDNA from two FeLV-free lymphoma cell lines (3201 and MCC) revealed a long open reading frame (ORF) encoding a truncated env gene product corresponding to the N-terminal portion of gp70env. Interestingly, all of three natural FeLV-B isolates include 3' env sequences which are missing from the highly transcribed subset and hence must be derived from other enFeLV elements. The enFeLV env ORF cDNA clones were closely similar to a previously characterized enFeLV provirus, CFE-16, but were polymorphic at a site corresponding to an exogenous FeLV neutralization epitope. Site-specific antiserum raised to a C-terminal 30-amino-acid peptide of the enFeLV env ORF detected an intracellular product of 35 kDa which was also shed from cells in stable form. Expression of the 35-kDa protein correlated with enFeLV RNA levels and was negatively correlated with susceptibility to infection with FeLV-B. Cell culture supernatant containing the 35-kDa protein specifically blocked infection of permissive fibroblast cells with FeLV-B isolates. We suggest that the truncated env protein mediates resistance by receptor blockade and that this form of enFeLV expression mediates the natural resistance of cats to infection with FeLV-B in the absence of FeLV-A.",

LMP1 has no intrinsic enzymatic activity but instead aggregates cellular proteins of the tumor necrosis factor receptor signaling pathway to activate transcription factor NF-kappaB. Mutants rendering LMP1 defective in these protein interactions are impaired in their abilities to activate NF-kappaB in reporter gene assays. Concordantly, EBV recombinants with LMP1 mutations that are compromised for NF-kappaB activation are impaired for growth transformation.

A critical review of recent literature prompts us 6 to propose a new hypothesis, designated Isolate, Amplify, and Select (IAS), that satisfactorily explains 7 the bottlenecks in single-stranded, positive sense (+) RNA virus infections. This new hypothesis 8 postulates that, unlike those in free-living organisms, the viral population bottlenecks are imposed by 9 viruses themselves, inside the infected cells, through virus-encoded bottleneck-enforcing proteins 10 (BNEPs) that function in a concentration-dependent manner. Most BNEPs are directly translated from 11 the (+) RNA genomes of invading viruses, so that if numerous virions of the same virus invade a cell 12 simultaneously, the bottleneck-ready concentration of BNEPs would be reached sufficiently early to 13 arrest nearly all internalized viral genomes. As a result, in these cells very few (as few as one) viral 14 genomes escape from the bottlenecks stochastically to initiate viral reproduction. Repetition of this 15 process in successively infected cells ensures the progeny genomes in each cell descend from the same 16 parental genome(s), hence isolating different mutant genomes in separate cells. This isolation precludes 17 mutant viral genomes encoding defective replication proteins from exploiting the complementing 18 proteins synthesized by sister genomes, leading to the prompt elimination of such mutants. Conversely, 19 the IAS model ensures replication proteins with beneficial mutations exclusively amplify the viral 20 genomes that harbor the very mutations. Reiteration of this process in consecutively infected cells 21 enriches such beneficial mutations in the virus pool. In conclusion, the IAS hypothesis provides a 22 compelling evolutionary model for population bottlenecks of (+) RNA viruses.",

      "http://ltsc.ieee.org/xsd/LOM/description" : "(PUBMED) A growing number of studies report that viruses can spread in groups in so-called collective infectious units. By increasing the cellular multiplicity of infection, collective dispersal may allow for social-like interactions, such as cooperation or cheating. Yet, little is known about how such interactions evolve. In previous work with vesicular stomatitis virus, we showed that virion aggregation accelerates early infection stages in most cell types, providing a short-term fitness benefit to the virus. Here, we examine the effects of virion aggregation over several infection cycles. Flow cytometry, deep sequencing, infectivity assays, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR, and electron microscopy revealed that virion aggregation rapidly promotes the emergence of defective interfering particles. Therefore, virion aggregation provides immediate fitness benefits to the virus but incurs fitness costs after a few viral generations. This suggests that an optimal strategy for the virus is to undergo virion aggregation only episodically, for instance, during interhost transmission.IMPORTANCE Recent insights have revealed that viruses use a highly diverse set of strategies to release multiple viral genomes into the same target cells, allowing the emergence of beneficial, but also detrimental, interactions among viruses inside infected cells. This has prompted interest among microbial ecologists and evolutionary biologists in studying how collective dispersal impacts the outcome of viral infections. Here, we have used vesicular stomatitis virus as a model system to study the evolutionary implications of collective dissemination mediated by viral aggregates, since this virus can spontaneously aggregate in the presence of saliva. We find that saliva-driven aggregation has a dual effect on viral fitness; whereas aggregation tends to increase infectivity in the very short term, virion aggregates are highly susceptible to invasion by noncooperative defective variants after a few viral generations.",

Here, we study the effect of defective interfering (DI) particle (DIP) co-infection on cell-to-cell variability in influenza A virus (IAV) replication. DIPs contain a large internal deletion in one of their eight viral RNAs (vRNA) and are, thus, defective in virus replication. Moreover, they interfere with virus replication. Using single-cell isolation and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, we uncovered a large between-cell heterogeneity in the DI vRNA content of infected cells, which was confirmed for DI mRNAs by single-cell RNA sequencing. A high load of intracellular DI vRNAs and DI mRNAs was found in low-productive cells, indicating their contribution to the large cell-to-cell variability in virus release. Furthermore, we show that the magnitude of host cell mRNA expression (some factors may inhibit virus replication), but not the ribosome content, may further affect the strength of single-cell virus replication. Finally, we show that the load of viral mRNAs (facilitating viral protein production) and the DI mRNA content are, independently from one another, connected with single-cell virus production. Together, these insights advance single-cell virology research toward the elucidation of the complex multi-parametric origin of the large cell-to-cell heterogeneity in virus infections.",

Molecular clones of FeLV-GM1 proviruses were obtained and studied by restriction enzyme mapping, blot hybridization and partial DNA sequence analysis. Two types of clone were isolated; the first was a replication-competent FeLV of subgroup A, resembling other low or minimally pathogenic FeLV-A isolates; the second was replication-defective with extensive deletions and mutations in gag and pol, although it has an intact env gene of subgroup B phenotype. Large segments of the defective proviruses, from the 5' leader sequence upstream of the gag gene to the 5' half of the env gene, show structural hallmarks of endogenous FeLV-related proviruses. Infectious FeLV-GM1 viruses recovered after transfection were tested for their leukaemogenic potential in newborn cats. Early polyclonal myeloproliferative changes were observed in cats inoculated with FeLV-A/GM1 alone, although these were more pronounced in animals receiving the full FeLV-AB/GM1 complex reconstituted by cotransfection of the defective virus FeLV-B with its FeLV-A helper. Analysis of viruses in the bone marrow showed that replication of the subgroup B component is delayed and restricted to a proportion of cats. Most of the infected cats developed persistent abnormalities of haematopoiesis and one progressed to disseminated myeloid leukaemia. The defective recombinant FeLV-B/GM1 appears to play an indirect but important role in myeloid leukaemogenesis.",

Greater than 95% of these proviruses detected in circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are referred to as \"defective\" by virtue of having large internal deletions and lethal genetic mutations. As these defective proviruses are unable to encode intact and replication-competent viruses, they have long been thought of as biologically irrelevant \"graveyard\" of viruses with little significance to HIV-1 pathogenesis. Contrary to this notion, we have recently demonstrated that these defective proviruses are not silent, are capable of transcribing novel unspliced forms of HIV-RNA transcripts with competent open reading frames (ORFs), and can be found in the peripheral blood CD4+ T cells of patients at all stages of HIV-1 infection. In the present study, by an approach of combining serial dilutions of CD4+ T cells and T cell-cloning technologies, we are able to demonstrate that defective proviruses that persist in HIV-infected individuals during suppressive cART are translationally competent and produce the HIV-1 Gag and Nef proteins. The HIV-RNA transcripts expressed from these defective proviruses may trigger an element of innate immunity. Likewise, the viral proteins coded in the defective proviruses may form extracellular virus-like particles and may trigger immune responses.

Incorporation of ribonucleotide analogues by the RdRp will either cause termination of RNA synthesis or mutagenesis of the RNA product. We demonstrated recently that incorporation of a pyrazine-carboxamide ribonucleotide into nascent RNA leads to pausing and backtracking of the elongating RdRp. Here, we provide evidence for the single-stranded RNA product of backtracking serving as an intermediate in RdRp-catalyzed, template-switching reactions. This intermediate is used for both intramolecular template-switching (copy-back RNA synthesis) and intermolecular template-switching (homologous RNA recombination). The use of a magnetic-tweezers platform to monitor RdRp elongation dynamics permitted direct observation of copy-back synthesis and illuminated properties of the RdRp that promote copy-back synthesis, including stability of the RdRp-nascent-RNA complex and the dimensions of the RdRp nucleic-acid-binding channel. In cells, recombination was stimulated by the presence of a pyrazine-carboxamide ribonucleotide. The effect of the drug on recombination was diminished for a recombination-defective virus, but this virus was not resistant to the drug. The discovery that a ribonucleotide analogue can induce copy-back RNA synthesis suggests that this third mechanistic class of compounds may function by promoting formation of defective viral genomes. This study identifies RdRp-catalyzed intra- and intermolecular template switching as a viable new mechanistic target with potentially broad-spectrum appeal.",

It is known that the accumulation of these defective particles can limit viral disease by interfering with the spread of fully infectious particles. In order to harness this phenomenon therapeutically, we defined which viral packaging signals were amenable to duplication and developed a viral genetic platform which produced replication competent IAVs that require up to two additional artificial genome segments for full infectivity. The modified and artificial genome segments propagated by this approach are capable of acting as \"decoy\" segments that, when packaged by coinfecting wild-type viruses, lead to the production of non-infectious viral particles. Although IAVs which require 10 genomic segments for full infectivity are able to replicate themselves and spread in vivo, their genomic modifications render them avirulent in mice. Administration of these viruses, both prophylactically and therapeutically, was able to rescue animals from a lethal influenza virus challenge.

      "http://ltsc.ieee.org/xsd/LOM/description" : "(OPENARCHIVES) Viral infections in pregnancy are major causes of maternal and fetal morbidity \nand mortality. Infections can develop in the neonate transplacentally, \nperinatally (from vaginal secretions or blood), or postnatally (from breast \nmilk or other sources). The clinical manifestations of neonatal infections vary \ndepending on the viral agent and gestational age at exposure. The risk of \ninfection is usually inversely related to gestational age at acquisition, some \nresulting in a congenital malformation syndrome. Infections known to produce \ncongenital defects have been described with the acronym TORCH (Toxoplasma, \nothers, rubella, cytomegalovirus [CMV], herpes). The &quot;others&quot; category has \nrapidly expanded to include several viruses known to cause neonatal disease. \nTraditionally, the viral infections of concern during pregnancy were those \ncaused by rubella virus, CMV, herpes simplex virus (HSV), and  parvovirus B19 \n(B19V). Toxoplasmosis is caused by infection with the protozoan Toxoplasma \ngondii, an obligate intracellular parasite. Approximately 10-20% of pregnant \nwomen infected with T gondii become symptomatic. The most common signs of \ninfection are lymphadenopathy and fever. If the mother was infected prior to \npregnancy, there is virtually no risk of fetal infection, as long as she \nremains immunocompetent. When a mother is infected with T gondii during \ngestation, the parasite may be disseminated hematogenously to the placenta. \nWhen this occurs, infection may be transmitted to the fetus transplacentally or \nduring vaginal delivery. The risk of infection to the fetus increases with the \ngestational age and is mild or not apparent at birth.  The most significant \nmanifestation of toxoplasmosis in the fetus is encephalomyelitis, which may \nhave severe results. Approximately 10% of prenatal T gondii infections result \nin abortion or neonatal death. In approximately 67-80% of prenatally infected \ninfants, the infection is subclinical and can be diagnosed using only \nserological and other laboratory methods. Although these infants appear healthy \nat birth, they may develop clinical symptoms and deficiencies later in life. \nCMV is a double-stranded DNA herpes virus and represents the most common \ncongenital viral infection. Primary, reactivation, or recurrent CMV infection \ncan occur in pregnancy and can lead to congenital CMV infection. Transplacental \ninfection can result in intrauterine growth restriction, sensorineural hearing \nloss, intracranial calcifications, microcephaly, hydrocephalus, \nhepatosplenomegaly, delayed psychomotor development, and/or optic atrophy. \nVertical transmission of CMV can occur at any stage of pregnancy; however, \nsevere sequelae are more common with infection in the first trimester, while \nthe overall risk of infection is greatest in the third trimester. Most (90%) \nCMV infections cause no symptoms, but 10% result in signs and symptoms, such as \ncongenital hearing loss (most common). However; thirty percent of infants with \nsevere CMV infection die; among survivors, more than half eventually develop \nneurological sequelae, including microcephaly, mental retardation, and/or \nsensorineural hearing loss. Rubella is one of the more teratogenic viruses. \nCongenital rubella syndrome (CRS) is characterized by intrauterine growth \nrestriction, intracranial calcifications, microcephaly, cataracts, cardiac \ndefects, neurologic disease, osteitis, and hepatosplenomegaly. Neonates with \nrubella may have a &quot;blueberry muffin&quot; appearance caused by purpuric skin \nlesions that result from extramedullary hematopoiesis. Heart defects in these \ninfants include ventricular septal defects, patent ductus arteriosus, pulmonary \nstenosis, and coarctation of the aorta. Most of these complications develop in \ninfants born to mothers who acquire rubella infection during the first 16 weeks \nof pregnancy. B19V causes erythema infectiosum (fifth disease). Although most \nadults with B19V infection are asymptomatic, the effects of this virus on the \nfetus are much greater and include miscarriage, fetal anemia, hydrops fetalis, \nmyocarditis, and/or intrauterine fetal death. I\nnfection occurs most frequently in the winter and spring. Thirty to 40% of \npregnant women are seronegative for B19V and are thus susceptible to infection. \nVarious studies have estimated that 3%-14% of intrauterine fetal deaths occur \nin the setting of B19V infection. Second-trimester infections have been studied \nmost frequently because infection in this trimester carries a 1%-3% risk of \nhydrops; however, infection in any trimester may result in intrauterine fetal \nloss.  Thirty to 60% of women receiving obstetric care have serologic evidence \nof past HSV infection. Approximately 10% of infections are congenital, usually \na consequence of the mother acquiring primary HSV infection during pregnancy \nand the fetus acquiring the infection transplacentally or via an ascending \ninfection from the cervix. Intrauterine infection is associated with \nintrauterine growth restriction, preterm labor, and miscarriage. The risk of \nneonatal herpes and death is highest in infants born to mothers who have not \nseroconverted by the time of delivery. HSV infection acquired in this manner \ncarries a 70% risk of dissemination and is associated with 3 distinct \nsyndromes, each with its own typical outcome. The first and most common (45%) \nis localized skin, eye, or mouth disease. Approximately 30% of cases manifest \nas central nervous system (CNS) disease, including meningitis or encephalitis, \nwith evidence of HSV DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).",

The basic concept and major advantage of the method, is that its training can be performed using simulation data, which result from a well established model, describing the dynamic response of defective rolling element bearings. Then, vibration measurements, resulting from the machine under condition monitoring, can be imported and processed directly by the already trained SVM, eliminating thus the need of training the SVM with experimental data of the specific defective bearing. A key aspect of the method is the data preprocessing approach, which among others, includes order analysis, in order to overcome problems related to sudden changes of the shaft rotating speed. Moreover, frequency domain features both from the raw signal as well as from the demodulated signal are used as inputs to the SVM classifiers for a two-stage recognition and classification procedure. At the first stage, a SVM classifier separates the normal condition signals from the faulty signals. At the second stage, a SVM classifier recognizes and categorizes the type of the fault. The effectiveness of the method tested in one literature established experimental test case and in three different industrial test cases, including a total number of 34 measurements. Each test case includes successive measurements from bearings under different types of defects, different loads and different rotation speeds. In all cases, the method presents 100% classification success. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

However, the composition and developmental regulation of the intine in rice (Oryza sativa) remain largely unknown. Here, we identify a microRNA, OsmiR528, which regulates the formation of the pollen intine and thus male fertility in rice. The mir528 knockout mutant aborted pollen development at the late binucleate pollen stage, significantly decreasing the seed-setting rate. We further demonstrated that OsmiR528 affects pollen development by directly targeting the uclacyanin gene OsUCL23 (encoding a member of the plant-specific blue copper protein family of phytocyanins) and regulating intine deposition. OsUCL23 overexpression phenocopied the mir528 mutant. The OsUCL23 protein localized in the prevacuolar compartments (PVCs) and multivesicular bodies (MVBs). We further revealed that OsUCL23 interacts with a member of the proton-dependent oligopeptide transport (POT) family of transporters to regulate various metabolic components, especially flavonoids. We propose a model in which OsmiR528 regulates pollen intine formation by directly targeting OsUCL23 and in which OsUCL23 interacts with the POT protein on the PVCs and MVBs to regulate the production of metabolites during pollen development. The study thus reveals the functions of OsmiR528 and an uclacyanin during pollen development.",

The main aim is to induce solubility and thereby enhance processability of the material, which is otherwise insoluble and inapplicable for technological applications when stacked in the form of graphite. In this frame, initially, graphite was oxidized under harsh conditions to yield exfoliated graphene oxide sheets, soluble in aqueous media and amenable to chemical modifications due to the presence of carboxylic acid groups at the edges of the lattice. Some donor-acceptor hybrid materials with photo- and/or electro-active components were prepared and characterized, while their charge-transfer properties were evaluated. However, it was obvious that the highly defected framework of graphene oxide cannot be really utilized in applications that are governed by charge-transfer processes, for example in solar cells. The alternative route for solubilizing and modifying graphene by exfoliating graphite is the current method of choice for the realization of novel hybrid materials and further boost their direct applicability in artificial photosynthesis and the construction of photovoltaic devices. In this review article, the routes for obtaining donor-acceptor graphene-based hybrid materials for managing charge-transfer phenomena, mainly, but not exclusively, with porphyrins and phthalocyanines are presented.

T. brucei regularly switches its major surface antigen, VSG, to evade the host immune responses. VSGs are exclusively expressed from subtelomeric expression sites (ESs) where VSG genes are flanked by upstream 70 bp repeats and downstream telomeric repeats. The telomere downstream of the active VSG is transcribed into a long-noncoding RNA (TERRA), which forms RNA:DNA hybrids (R-loops) with the telomeric DNA. At an elevated level, telomere R-loops cause more telomeric and subtelomeric double-strand breaks (DSBs) and increase VSG switching rate. In addition, stabilized R-loops are observed at the 70 bp repeats and immediately downstream of ES-linked VSGs in RNase H defective cells, which also have an increased amount of subtelomeric DSBs and more frequent VSG switching. Although subtelomere plasticity is expected to be beneficial to antigenic variation, severe defects in subtelomere integrity and stability increase cell lethality. Therefore, regulation of the telomere and 70 bp repeat R-loop levels is important for the balance between antigenic variation and cell fitness in T. brucei. In addition, the high level of the active ES transcription favors accumulation of R-loops at the telomere and 70 bp repeats, providing an intrinsic mechanism for local DSB formation, which is a strong inducer of VSG switching.",

However, it remains to be explored whether and how centrosomes also facilitate the progression through different phases of the cell cycle. Here we show that impairing the composition of centrosomes, by depletion of centrosomal components or by inhibition of polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4), reduces the progression of DNA replication forks. This occurs even when the cell cycle is arrested before damaging the centrosomes, thus excluding mitotic failure as the source of replication stress. Mechanistically, the kinase MLK3 associates with centrosomes. When centrosomes are disintegrated, MLK3 activates the kinases p38 and MK2/MAPKAPK2. Transcription-dependent RNA:DNA hybrids (R-loops) are then causing DNA replication stress. Fibroblasts from patients with microcephalic primordial dwarfism (Seckel syndrome) harbouring defective centrosomes showed replication stress and diminished proliferation, which were each alleviated by inhibition of MK2. Thus, centrosomes not only facilitate mitosis, but their integrity is also supportive in DNA replication.

The hierarchical 3D architectured Ag NW@NiMn-LDH catalysts exhibit superb OER/ORR activities in alkaline conditions. The outstanding bifunctional activities of Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs are essentially attributed to increasing both site activity and site populations. The synergistic contributions from the hierarchical 3D open-pore structure of the LDH shells, improved electrical conductivity, and small thickness of the LDHs shells are associated with more accessible site populations. Moreover, the charge transfer between Ag cores and metals of LDH shells and the formation of defective and distorted sites (less coordinated Ni and Mn sites) strongly enhance the site activity. Thus, Ag NW@NiMn-LDH hybrids exhibit a 0.75 V overvoltage difference between ORR and OER with excellent durability for 30 h, demonstrating the distinguished bifunctional electrocatalyst reported to date. Interestingly, the homemade rechargeable Zn-air battery using the hybrid Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs (1:2) catalyst as the air electrode exhibits a charge-discharge voltage gap of ∼0.77 V at 10 mA cm-2 and shows excellent cycling stability.

We generated a separation of function mutant, sen1-3, which abolishes replisome binding without affecting transcription termination. We observe that the sen1-3 mutants show increased genome instability and recombination levels. Moreover, sen1-3 is synthetically defective with mutations in genes involved in RNA metabolism and the S phase checkpoint. RNH1 overexpression suppresses defects in the former, but not the latter.

Compared to the MPW hybrids and phosphotungstic acid hydrate, the TCN photocatalysts showed excellent visible light photocatalytic activity. During the thermal transformation, the melamine molecules polymerize to form the defective heptazine structure carbonitride attached to the surface of mixed-valence Keggin units. The interfacial POMs anions-π interactions, ligand-to-metal charge transfer and mix-valence organic-POMs structure makes the electrons fully delocalized over the MPW hybrids, and the TCN photocatalysts obtain the extended light absorption.

We demonstrated that the establishment of seed garden under natural pollination is possible and produces a sufficient amount of hybrid seeds to be multiplied efficiently and economically. As expected for F1 hybrid, the performances of Starmaya are highly superior to conventional cultivars. However, we observed some heterogeneity on Starmaya cultivar in the field. We confirmed by genetic marker analysis that the off-types were partly related to the heterozygosity of the CIR-SM01 clone and could not be modified. Regarding the level of rust resistance of Starmaya cv., we saw that it could be improved if Marsellesa was more fully fixed genetically. If so, we should be able to decrease significantly the percentage of rust incidence of Starmaya from 15 to 5%, which would be quite acceptable at a commercial level. Starmaya represents the proof of concept for the mass propagation of Arabica F1 hybrid seeds using male sterility. Finally, we discuss the possibility to increase the number of hybrid varieties produced by seed, exploring some initiatives to identify male sterility markers to induce male sterility on any conventional cultivar. This would definitively open up the universe of known Arabica cultivars to be used in breeding new F1 hybrids.",

At least one essential gene of the virus is deleted, either in its entirety, or sufficiently to make it non-functional. The resulting DI genome is then defective for replication in the absence of the product(s) of the deleted gene(s), and its replication requires the presence of the complete functional virus genome to provide the missing functions. In addition to being defective DI virus suppresses production of the helper virus in co-infected cells, and this process of interference can readily be observed in cultured cells. In some cases, DI virus has been observed to attenuate disease in virus-infected animals. In this article, we review the properties of DI virus, potential mechanisms of interference and progress in using DI virus (in particular that derived from influenza A virus) as a novel type of antiviral agent.",

These collective infectious units can consist of multiple viral genomes inside the same virion, or multiple virions inside a larger structure such as a vesicle. Collective infectious units deliver multiple viral genomes to the same cell simultaneously, which can have important implications for viral pathogenesis, antiviral resistance, and social evolution. However, little is known about why some viruses transmit in collective infectious units, whereas others do not. We used a simple evolutionary approach to model the potential costs and benefits of transmitting in a collective infectious unit. We found that collective infectious units could be favoured if cells infected by multiple viral genomes were significantly more productive than cells infected by just one viral genome, and especially if there were also efficiency benefits to packaging multiple viral genomes inside the same infectious unit. We also found that if some viral sequences are defective, then collective infectious units could evolve to become very large, but that if these defective sequences interfered with wild-type virus replication, then collective infectious units were disfavoured.",

However, because DI viruses cannot replicate autonomously without the aid of an infectious helper virus, clonal DI virus stocks that are not contaminated with helper virus have not yet been generated. To overcome this problem, we used reverse genetics to generate a clonal DI virus with a PB2 DI gene, amplified the clonal DI virus using a cell line stably expressing the PB2 protein, and confirmed its ability to interfere with infectious virus replication in vitro. Thus, our approach is suitable for obtaining purely clonal DI viruses, will contribute to the understanding of DI virus interference mechanisms and can be used to develop DI virus-based antivirals.",

      "http://ltsc.ieee.org/xsd/LOM/description" : "(PUBMED) A growing number of studies report that viruses can spread in groups in so-called collective infectious units. By increasing the cellular multiplicity of infection, collective dispersal may allow for social-like interactions, such as cooperation or cheating. Yet, little is known about how such interactions evolve. In previous work with vesicular stomatitis virus, we showed that virion aggregation accelerates early infection stages in most cell types, providing a short-term fitness benefit to the virus. Here, we examine the effects of virion aggregation over several infection cycles. Flow cytometry, deep sequencing, infectivity assays, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR, and electron microscopy revealed that virion aggregation rapidly promotes the emergence of defective interfering particles. Therefore, virion aggregation provides immediate fitness benefits to the virus but incurs fitness costs after a few viral generations. This suggests that an optimal strategy for the virus is to undergo virion aggregation only episodically, for instance, during interhost transmission.IMPORTANCE Recent insights have revealed that viruses use a highly diverse set of strategies to release multiple viral genomes into the same target cells, allowing the emergence of beneficial, but also detrimental, interactions among viruses inside infected cells. This has prompted interest among microbial ecologists and evolutionary biologists in studying how collective dispersal impacts the outcome of viral infections. Here, we have used vesicular stomatitis virus as a model system to study the evolutionary implications of collective dissemination mediated by viral aggregates, since this virus can spontaneously aggregate in the presence of saliva. We find that saliva-driven aggregation has a dual effect on viral fitness; whereas aggregation tends to increase infectivity in the very short term, virion aggregates are highly susceptible to invasion by noncooperative defective variants after a few viral generations.",

      "http://ltsc.ieee.org/xsd/LOM/description" : "(PUBMED) Influenza A viruses (IAVs) encode their genome across eight, negative sense RNA segments. During viral assembly, the failure to package all eight segments, or packaging a mutated segment, renders the resulting virion incompletely infectious. It is known that the accumulation of these defective particles can limit viral disease by interfering with the spread of fully infectious particles. In order to harness this phenomenon therapeutically, we defined which viral packaging signals were amenable to duplication and developed a viral genetic platform which produced replication competent IAVs that require up to two additional artificial genome segments for full infectivity. The modified and artificial genome segments propagated by this approach are capable of acting as \"decoy\" segments that, when packaged by coinfecting wild-type viruses, lead to the production of non-infectious viral particles. Although IAVs which require 10 genomic segments for full infectivity are able to replicate themselves and spread in vivo, their genomic modifications render them avirulent in mice. Administration of these viruses, both prophylactically and therapeutically, was able to rescue animals from a lethal influenza virus challenge. Together, our results show that replicating IAVs designed to propagate and spread defective genomic segments represent a potent anti-influenza biological therapy that can target the conserved process of particle assembly to limit viral disease.",
