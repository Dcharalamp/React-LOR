	"description": "(OPENARCHIVES) A model for virus transport in one-dimensional, homogeneous, saturated\nporous media is developed, accounting for virus sorption and inactivation of liquid phase\nand adsorbed viruses with different time dependent rate coefficients. The virus inactivation\nprocess is represented by a pseudo first-order rate expression. The pseudo first-order\napproximation is shown to simulate available experimental data from three virus\ninactivation batch studies better than the frequently employed constant rate inactivation\nmodel. Model simulations indicated that the pseudo first-order approximation, compared\nto the constant inactivation, leads to extended survival of viruses and, consequently, more\ndistant migration. Results from a parameter sensitivity analysis demonstrated that\nestimation of pseudo first-order inactivation rate coefficients from field observations\nrequires data collection near the source of virus contamination during initial stages of\nvirus transport.",
